<div class="content-left">
  <p>I’m Hyeonji, a Korean living in Berlin, Germany.</p>

  <p>
    I work as a product designer at a tech company, but outside of work I write
    down thoughts about the things I notice, read, and live through.
  </p>

  <p>
    I named this blog <em>Greenhouse</em> because,like a greenhouse where
    different plants grow at their own pace, this space holds small ideas,
    unfinished thoughts, and things still becoming.
  </p>

  <p>And yes, I do love actual plants too.</p>
