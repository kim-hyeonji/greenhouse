Everyone is told to work out because it’s good for both the body and mental health. Of course, I’ve heard this countless times since I was a kid, and I hated it. In my twenties, I loved staying in bed and did everything there as much as I could: reading, watching TV shows, and of course, sleeping **far too much**.

After I moved to Berlin and was living in a shared flat, I still loved lying down all the time. Looking back, I think I was really weary and vulnerable at that time. While I was doing my Master’s degree and working part-time, I longed for a simple life where I could focus on just one thing at a time. That might sound like an excuse, but back then I simply didn’t have the energy or interest to prioritize exercise, except for running occasionally. Once I got a full-time job after graduation, I finally started caring about my health and workout habits ~~(with some peer pressure from my sporty partner).~~

I had to build a workout habit because I needed something I could do without looking at a screen outside of work. I also wanted to test myself: _did I really hate sports, or had I just not discovered the kinds that suited me?_

### Looking back on 2025

I tried hard to build a solid workout habit in 2025, and I found out which sports suited me and which didn’t. Running is the sport I’ve done for the longest time, since 2016. Even though I wasn’t very consistent, I went running whenever I felt like it. So I knew that I enjoy cardio, and I started running more regularly. A good friend of mine V recommended a spinning studio near the office, so I started going there and eventually went once a week. I also attended some dance, barre, and Pilates classes. Here is my analog workout tracker:

  'The legend of the chart is not well organized because I didn’t categorize the workouts very well. Basically, the orange color represents cardio workouts.' %}

Looking back, I realized two important things. First, I like exercises that push me to my limits within a timeframe, such as HIIT training. Second, I prefer workouts with clear goals and endings, like “run 5 km” or “attend a spinning class.” I tried going to the gym regularly, but I couldn’t stick with it because it felt too open-ended.

### 2026 plan

If you look at the tracker, you can see that I did a lot of cardio workouts last year. This year, I added more strength training plans that are not open-ended. I asked ChatGPT to plan some home workouts, and I’m doing them alongside my regular cardio sessions. Here is my current tracker. I made the legend more scalable:

  'Clearly I’m doing less cardio than last year. I should keep it up.' %}
