At the end of last year, I set my resolutions for 2026, as usual. I’ve been doing this for a while, so I always end up with similar themes: Reading, Workout, Learning, Career, and Miscellaneous. I kept these categories for this year as well, but I added one more: _Journaling_.

Last year, I focused on reading because I wanted to bring my reading habit back after losing it. But for some reason, I always had the urge to write something and share it. So this year, I want to write more. This will be my main theme, while I keep my reading momentum.

Actually, journaling wasn’t the first idea that came to mind. Somehow, my YouTube algorithm led me to a few videos about how to stop doomscrolling on your phone and stay sane. I’m not a big YouTube watcher — I’m not patient enough to watch videos longer than 10 minutes — but these keywords caught my attention (the list is at the bottom). And the idea of journaling regularly made me excited.

I used to write a lot, but now I don’t do it very often. Part of that is my perfectionist and avoidant behavior — if I want to write something, I want to do it _right_. But we all know there’s no such thing as perfection. So I shifted my mindset a bit and started pouring my thoughts into my diary, which I’ve been keeping since 2018. I didn’t completely stop doomscrolling on my phone, but I did reduce my screen time. A small win.

_The black diary in the middle is my longest-running Leuchtturm diary. The mint one at the bottom is also a Leuchtturm, but I’m using it for book notes. On top is my beautiful Traveler’s Notebook, which I bought this year at [Luiban Papeterie in Berlin](https://luiban.com/) as a present for myself. I use it as my EDC._

_Luiban is an official Traveler’s Notebook shop, so you can ask the staff for a stamp if you buy one. I got two beautiful stamps on a note right after I bought it._

Okay, enough about why I want to write more. This feels like a good time to write about why I built this personal blog as well.

I actually already have a digital blog where I’ve been uploading weekly journals since 2019, hosted on Naver. But I wanted a second place with no strings attached. And since AI has been everywhere lately, I wanted to try this “vibe coding” thing — and it worked.

I prompted ChatGPT that I wanted to build a personal blog for free where I could upload Markdown files. I also mentioned that I have some basic HTML and CSS knowledge. Still, I’m not a developer, so I had to ask ChatGPT everything, one step at a time, to build the blog from scratch.

Of course, the process was very unprofessional and messy. I’m not sure whether it’s worth sharing how to build your own blog with ChatGPT, but I might write a post about it later.
