## Reason for choosing the book

I’ve heard about this book here and there since last year for some reason, but nothing triggered me to actually start reading it. And I saw the first trailer of the movie based on the novel, which will come out next year, I just decided to read it.

## Overview

A normal person is trying to accomplish an abnormal mission, and meets many friends along the way.

## Notes

While reading, I asked myself, “What would I do in this situation?”. If the premise is that the world is dying from an apocalyptic disaster sooner or later, would I just stay on Earth waiting for the doomsday, or would I hop on the spaceship? Perhaps I would choose the former if I hadn’t read this book. Because I’m tired of striving to live, I don’t want to add any stress on top of my current situation, especially if I know that I’ll die soon. I was a bit like Grace, a coward, just wanted to stay within the comfort zone. I’m a person who would choose to be a zombie, rather than trying to survive the horrible zombie apocalypse. However, whether he agreed on it or not, he was shot into space, left as a lonely astronaut. But he experienced what nobody on earth would do. He was able to utilize all the tremendous scientific knowledge, encounter an alien for the first time in human history, and become a friend with them. I personally loved the part where Grace made a translation system to communicate with Rocky, and to see how these two intelligent creatures help each other. By the way, I’m sure the author created the Eridian language based on the _<Have Space Suit—Will Travel>_ written by Robert A. Heinlein. (Fun fact: Heinlein is also mentioned in the novel.)

Although I enjoyed reading a lot, I would say I could have enjoyed this book much more if I had some scientific background. I never took science seriously during school time, so it was a bit of a bummer that some detailed descriptions of the biological experiments, molecules, etc., I was not able to fully understand. But I think the author expected that the majority of the readers are basically like me. At the end of the long descriptions, there was always a key summarizing sentence that explained what was going on in easy language. So I had no problem following the story. Just a bit sad that I can only understand some parts vaguely.

Overall, I really loved the book, and I dug into Reddit rabbit holes. I do like reading SF, and I read pretty much, but I particularly liked _<Project Hail Mary>_ because it is somehow following all the stories of the classic space SF, but the events are very unpredictable. It’s also because the novel is not written chronologically, but following Grace’s mind flow. That is why the book was a great page-turner.

And I think I can enjoy a book more if the characters are relatable and likeable. I’d say most of the characters are like this in this book — even Stratt, of course. As the character itself knows, the execution style of Stratt is outlawry, which is not right. But for the sake of the apocalypse, she doesn’t stand back, just being more pushy and merciless — in Korean, we’d say ‘she doesn’t have blood and tears (피도 눈물도 없다)’. But in the end, it was for good. I liked that Sandra Hüller got this role. I can definitely imagine that she’ll nail it. And of course, Rocky is a remarkable character. I think Rocky would be the most friendly alien after E.T. The first farewell scene will live in my memory for a while. Actually, just this reading experience will be in my heart for a while. I have the next book prepared (Orbital), but I don’t dare to start it already, because I just want to jot down all my thoughts here and digest everything before I start another book.
