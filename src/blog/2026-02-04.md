Today is the beginning of spring according to the traditional 24 seasonal divisions in Korea, called “입춘(立春).” Obviously, that doesn’t mean winter suddenly stops and the air immediately gets warmer. When I woke up today, it had actually snowed more in Berlin. It has been almost seven years since I moved here, and I have never felt it this cold before. This year’s January was reported to be [the coldest in Berlin in the past 16 years](https://www.wetteronline.de/wetterticker/kaeltester-januar-seit-2010-in-berlin-und-hamburg--6fcf3d7c-9860-4edb-a2bc-b2ef0815f9bf).

I had never really noticed this before, but apparently there is a list of things you should not do on the first day of spring. There is a saying that if you do any of them, your year will not go very smoothly. I’m not superstitious, but I am a little stitious, so I read the list and tried to avoid these things today. Here is the list:

1. **Do not lend money or make impulse purchases.** You might spend too much this year if you do.
2. **Do not argue with your family.** Fortune will not stay if the home is noisy.
3. **Do not clean up your house.** You might clean away good fortune as well.
4. **Do not break anything.** Breaking something is considered very ominous.
5. **Do not get drunk until late in the evening.** Stay sane at the beginning of the year so that you can stay sane throughout the year.
6. **Do not get a haircut or cut your nails.** They represent vitality.
7. **Do not wear only black.** It does not match the fresh spring vibe.
8. **Do not sigh or say negative things.** Negative energy can sabotage the year’s fortune.
9. **Do not take a nap.** You might stay like this all year.
10. **Do not wear a new pair of shoes.** Your feet may suffer all year long.

I was so close to breaking the first rule while checking things online, but I closed the tab just in time. I don’t take it too seriously, but why not try, just for a day.
